           <h2>Monetization:</h2>
           <p>The business Model we would be using for our game “Hero Time” would be freemium model. As in freemium model the players can access the basic features of the game and they can even play game if they don’t want to pay.  Users gain access to all levels, but the gameplay provides in-app purchases that make it easier for gamers to complete the game. In order to make users connected with our game we would provide them will all the levels and all the basic features of our game however there would be a option of “in-game purchase” where user can pay amount to access a certain feature. For example, if user want to upgrade the character or the game environment he would have initially, those assets locked, but then he has to pay money in order to access them. The main reason of using this business model is that the gamers are not obliged to make purchases forcefully.If they want to play with defaults features they can do it. This model keeps the gamers loyal and allows attracting a large audience right after the product release. In this case, players decide how much money to spend on the game and whether it is worth doing it at all. For the very same reason, developers have to work hard to retain user interest and strive to get maximum installations.</p>
           <p>As the game consists of several levels and in each level player's goal is to protect the infinity stones, so if in certain level the health of character finishes then he has to buy some energy boosters. The user can pick necessary assets for several level, in which many assets will be free while some needs to be bought in order to be used. This business plan will be considered and applied throughout the game to earn the profit & make money.</p>
           <h2>Marketing Startegies:</h2>
           <p>Following marketing strategies would be used by the game developers to let people know about the game:</p>
           <ol>
               <li>App store: The game would be made available on the appstore. As many people discover games on the playstore so this strategy will help us with users interaction. It would also help them to write a review of our game which would considered in advancing the game features .</li>
               <li>Social Media Platform: As social media is used by most of the population and is highly popular among people, so we will promote our game on social media. For example we can post in some games related group or even post on our timeline to let people know. Or we can can promote our game through facebook pages. The apk file will be made available for people to experience the game and then give us review to make furthur improvements.</li>
